This is a shopping cart application , made with angular.

This dynamically selects discounts depending on cart items and how many times the item occurs.

For example For ten items of fruit you can reduce the price of one bat by 10 dollars.

or , if the total cart value is above 1000 dollar you get 50 percent off.

The entire operation is done on the client side. Nothing is hard coded.

Everything is dynamic. It is scalable.
